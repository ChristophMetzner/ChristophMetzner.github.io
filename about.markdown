I am currently a postdoc at the [Neural Information Processing Group](https://www.ni.tu-berlin.de/menue/neural_information_processing_group/) led by Prof. Obermayer at the Technische Universit√§t Berlin, Berlin, Germany. I am trained both in mathemtics and computer science and have a broad interest in all types of scientific problems. However, my main expertise is in the field of Computational Neuroscience and Computational Psychiatry. I have experience in analysing and modelling neural data on many different scales, from biophysically detailed, realistic single cells (using Neuron, Genesis and NetPyNE) to whole brain networks (using SPM, Python, Nest, Brian, FSL). I am also very interest in open and reproducible research and a member and reviewer of the [ReScience initiative](http://rescience.github.io/). I am a member of the [Organization of Computational Neurosciences (OCNS)](cnsorg.org) and have served as a member of its program committee for the annual meeting for the last 3 years; and a member of the [Bernstein Network Computational Neuroscience](https://www.bernstein-network.de/de/bernstein-association/join).
