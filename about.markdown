I am currently a postdoc at the [Neural Information Processing Group](https://www.ni.tu-berlin.de/menue/neural_information_processing_group/) led by Prof. Obermayer at the Technische Universität Berlin, Germany. Furthermore, I am a visiting lecturer at the University of Hertfordshire, United Kingdom, and at the University of Applied Sciences Berlin, Germany. Before that I was a postdoc in the Biocomputation Group led by Prof. Steuber at the University of Hertfordshire after having received my PhD at the University of Lübeck working with Prof. Schweikard and Dr. Zurowski. I am trained both in mathematics and computer science and have a broad interest in all types of scientific problems. However, my main expertise is in the field of Computational Neuroscience and Computational Psychiatry. I have experience in analysing and modelling neural data on many different scales, from biophysically detailed, realistic single cells (using Neuron, Genesis and NetPyNE) to whole brain networks (using SPM, Python, Nest, Brian, FSL). I am also very interest in open and reproducible research and a member and reviewer of the [ReScience initiative](http://rescience.github.io/). I am a member of the [Organization of Computational Neurosciences (OCNS)](cnsorg.org) and have served as a member of its program committee for the annual meeting for the last 3 years; and a member of the [Bernstein Network Computational Neuroscience](https://www.bernstein-network.de/de/bernstein-association/join).  

## Research
My research aims to use computational models at mutliple scales (from single cells to large brain structures) to understand sensory processing and cognitive functions. Furthermore, also to use these models to uncover biological mechanisms underlying psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, to identify novel, more effective treatments.
