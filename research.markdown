### Auditory Steady-State Response Deficits
Since synchronized neuronal activity is thought to underlie efficient communication in the brain and to be crucially involved in working memory processes, alterations of this synchrony, as found in electroencephalogram (EEG) or magnetoencephalogram (MEG) studies of patients suffering from schizophrenia (SCZ) might contribute to the symptoms in patients and impairments characterizing schizophrenia. One very robust finding in EEG/MEG studies of schizophrenia patients is a deficit in the gamma band auditory steady-state response (ASSR). Over the last years, I have developed various models to look at the mechanisms underlying this deficit (see [here](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2016.00089/full), [here](http://rescience.github.io/bibliography/metzner_2017.html), [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-53682-5)) and built a Python framework to automatically validate such models against experimental observations (see [here](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/full/10.1162/cpsy_a_00015)).

### Synchronization of E-I Networks
Gamma rhythms play a major role in different processes in the brain, such as attention, working memory and sensory processing. The communication-through-coherence (CTC) hypothesis suggests that synchronization in the gamma band is one of the key mechanisms in neuronal communication and counterintuitively noise can have beneficial effects on the communication. Recently, [Meng and Riecke](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-24670-y) showed that synchronization *across* interacting inhibitory networks (producing gamma rhythm through an ING mechanism) increases while synchronization *within* these networks decreases when neurons are subject to independent noise. However, experimental and modeling studies point towards an important role of the PING mechanism in the cortex and the established view is that cortico-cortical connections are predominately excitatory.
In his master thesis, my student Lucas Rebscher, reproduced the findings in ING networks of adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire (AdEx) neurons and extended the work by showing that the same synchronization mechanism can be observed in interacting gamma rhythms produced by a PING mechanism.
