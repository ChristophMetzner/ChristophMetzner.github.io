### Auditory Steady-State Response Deficits
Since synchronized neuronal activity is thought to underlie efficient communication in the brain and to be crucially involved in working memory processes, alterations of this synchrony, as found in electroencephalogram (EEG) or magnetoencephalogram (MEG) studies of patients suffering from schizophrenia (SCZ) might contribute to the symptoms in patients and impairments characterizing schizophrenia. One very robust finding in EEG/MEG studies of schizophrenia patients is a deficit in the gamma band auditory steady-state response (ASSR). Over the last years, I have developed various models to look at the mechanisms underlying this deficit (see [here](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2016.00089/full), [here](http://rescience.github.io/bibliography/metzner_2017.html), [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-53682-5)) and built a Python framework to automatically validate such models against experimental observations (see [here](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/full/10.1162/cpsy_a_00015)).
